### Sentence Structure Variety

#### Pattern Breaking Rules
1. **Vary sentence length:** Mix 5-word sentences with 25-word sentences
2. **Vary sentence openings:** Don't start 3+ sentences in a row the same way
3. **Vary paragraph length:** Single-sentence paragraphs are powerful when used sparingly
4. **Vary punctuation:** Use dashes, semicolons, and colons naturally

#### Rhythm Guidelines
- **Short sentences:** Use for emphasis, tension, or clarity
- **Long sentences:** Use for flow, description, or complex ideas
- **Fragments:** Acceptable in dialogue and for stylistic effect
- **Questions:** Engage reader directly but don't overuse

## Natural Language Patterns

### Dialogue Guidelines

#### Making Characters Sound Human
**AVOID:**
- Perfect grammar in casual speech
- Everyone speaking in complete sentences
- Overly formal language in informal settings
- Characters who never interrupt or overlap

**INCLUDE:**
- Contractions (I'm, won't, didn't)
- Incomplete thoughts
- Regional expressions (sparingly)
- Character-specific speech patterns
- Natural interruptions
- Realistic "um," "uh," "well" (sparingly)

#### Dialogue Tags
**AVOID:**
- Exotic dialogue tags (ejaculated, expostulated, etc.)
- Overusing "said" alternatives
- Adverb-heavy tags ("he said angrily")

**PREFER:**
- "Said" and "asked" for 80% of tags
- Action beats instead of tags
- Let dialogue convey emotion

### Description Techniques

#### Sensory Writing
**For Each Scene Include:**
- What characters see (beyond obvious)
- What they hear (background sounds)
- What they smell (often forgotten)
- What they feel (temperature, texture)
- What they taste (when relevant)

**Balance Rule:** No more than 3 senses per paragraph unless crafting immersive scene

#### Specific vs. Generic
**AVOID:**
- "Beautiful sunset"
- "Delicious food"
- "Nice weather"
- "Interesting conversation"

**PREFER:**
- "Sunset bleeding orange into purple"
- "Garlic-heavy pasta that burned his tongue"
- "Humid air that clung like wet cloth"
- "Conversation that danced around the real issue"

## Chapter Structure Principles

### Universal Chapter Guidelines

#### Effective Chapter Openings
- Start in media res when possible
- Hook with action, dialogue, or intriguing observation
- Orient readers quickly but subtly
- Avoid lengthy exposition or backstory
- Connect to previous chapter's momentum

#### Chapter Development
**For Narrative Content (Stories, Case Studies, Examples):**
- Balance scene and narrative summary
- Vary scene types (action, dialogue, reflection)
- Ensure each section advances plot AND character/subject
- Include both external and internal conflict
- Show change or revelation

**For Informational Content (Guides, Analysis, Arguments):**
- Open with engaging hook (anecdote, question, fact)
- Present one core idea per section
- Support with varied evidence types
- Include practical applications
- Connect to overall thesis

#### Chapter Conclusions
- Provide sense of completion for chapter arc
- Create momentum toward next chapter
- Avoid neat wrap-ups that kill tension
- Use cliffhangers sparingly but effectively
- Echo or transform opening image/idea

#### Optimal Chapter Length
- **Standard range:** 2,000-4,000 words
- **Short chapters:** Use for emphasis, pace changes
- **Long chapters:** Only when content demands
- **Consistency:** Maintain relatively uniform lengths
- **Flexibility:** Let content dictate final length

### Chapter Flow and Transitions

#### Internal Flow
- Vary paragraph lengths (1-7 sentences)
- Use white space for emphasis
- Create rhythm through sentence variation
- Smooth transitions between scenes/ideas
- Maintain consistent time flow

#### Chapter-to-Chapter Flow
- Each chapter should feel necessary
- Clear cause-and-effect between chapters
- Avoid repetitive chapter structures
- Escalate stakes/complexity gradually
- Plant seeds that bloom in later chapters

## Content-Specific Guidelines

### For Narrative Content (Stories, Case Studies, Memoirs)

#### Character/Subject Consistency
- **Voice Differentiation:** Each person needs 2-3 unique speech patterns
- **Behavior Patterns:** People should have consistent habits/tics
- **Growth Tracking:** Change happens gradually, not suddenly
- **Motivation Clarity:** Every action needs believable motivation

#### Story/Case Development
- **Show vs. Tell Ratio:** Aim for 80% showing, 20% telling
- **Conflict Escalation:** Each section should raise stakes
- **Pacing Variety:** Action scenes followed by reflection
- **Foreshadowing:** Plant seeds 2-3 sections before payoff

### For Informational Content (Guides, Analysis, Teaching)

#### Authority Building
- **Expertise Display:** Demonstrate knowledge through specifics, not claims
- **Source Integration:** Weave research naturally into narrative
- **Balanced Perspectives:** Present complexity, not just one side
- **Personal Connection:** Include relevant examples strategically

#### Engagement Techniques
- **Question Hooks:** Start sections with reader's likely questions
- **Practical Applications:** Connect theory to reader's needs
- **Example Integration:** Real instances every 3-5 pages
- **Takeaway Clarity:** Each section needs clear value

### For Technical Content (Manuals, Documentation, Instructions)

#### Clarity Standards
- **Term Definition:** Define technical terms on first use
- **Progressive Complexity:** Build from simple to complex
- **Visual Support:** Indicate where diagrams would help
- **Step Verification:** Test all procedures before including

#### User Focus
- **Task Orientation:** Focus on what users need to do
- **Common Pitfalls:** Address typical errors proactively
- **Success Indicators:** Show what correct results look like
- **Troubleshooting:** Provide solutions to common problems

## Consistency Maintenance

### Fact Tracking
**Track Throughout Project:**
- Names, descriptions, relationships of all key elements
- Timeline events and dates
- Location descriptions and spatial relationships
- Technical specifications or rules
- Terminology and definitions
- Statistical claims and sources
- Any established facts or constraints

### Style Consistency Checklist
- [ ] Same spelling for names/places throughout
- [ ] Consistent use of numbers (spelled out vs. digits)
- [ ] Consistent formatting (italics, bold, etc.)
- [ ] Consistent tense usage
- [ ] Consistent POV (first/third, past/present)
- [ ] Consistent chapter structure

## AI-Specific Writing Rules

### Chapter Generation Guidelines
1. **Never summarize** what you're about to write
2. **Start in media res** - middle of action or thought
3. **End with momentum** - not summary or conclusion
4. **Vary chapter openings** - action, dialogue, description, thought
5. **Trust previous context** - don't re-explain established facts

### Paragraph Construction
1. **Topic sentence variety** - not always first
2. **Length variety** - 1-7 sentences
3. **Transition variety** - not always explicit
4. **Internal logic** - each sentence advances the thought

### Word Choice Principles
1. **Specific over general** - "maple" not "tree"
2. **Concrete over abstract** - "clenched fists" not "angry"
3. **Familiar over fancy** - unless character demands it
4. **Fresh over cliché** - avoid tired metaphors

## Revision Prompts for AI

### After Writing Each Section, Check:
1. Have I used any of the "avoid" phrases?
2. Do 3+ sentences start the same way?
3. Is dialogue too perfect/formal?
4. Am I telling when I could show?
5. Have I included sensory details?
6. Does this sound like a human wrote it?

### Red Flags for Revision
- Paragraphs that summarize previous paragraphs
- Sentences that explain what was just shown
- Dialogue without contractions or interruptions
- Description without specific details
- Transitions that feel mechanical
