# Overview Dashboard Usage Guide

## Purpose of 00_overview.md

The **00_overview.md** file serves as your project's central command center. It combines the book concept with real-time progress tracking, making it the single most important document for AI collaboration.

## For Human Authors

### Start of Each Session
1. Update the **Last Activity** in Project Status Dashboard
2. Review and update **Next Priority** based on your goals
3. Modify **AI Quick Start** section to guide the AI's focus

### End of Each Session
1. Update **Activity Log** with what you accomplished
2. Update **Document Completion Tracker** percentages
3. Add any new decisions to **Key Decisions Made**
4. Refresh **Next Steps and Priorities**
5. Note successful AI collaboration patterns

### Weekly Maintenance
- Review overall completion percentage
- Update milestone dates
- Clean up completed tasks
- Reassess priorities

## For AI Assistants

### Always Start Here
When beginning any session, **00_overview.md** tells you:
- Current project phase and completion status
- Which documents to prioritize reviewing
- Recent activities and current momentum
- Specific next steps the author wants to focus on

### How to Read the Dashboard

**Project Status Dashboard**
- Gives you immediate context
- Shows exactly where the project stands
- Identifies the working chapter
- Lists documents you should and shouldn't review

**Activity Log**
- Understand what happened recently
- Maintain continuity from previous sessions
- Recognize patterns in the author's work

**Next Steps**
- These are the author's stated priorities
- Offer to tackle these first
- But remain flexible if they want something different

## Best Practices

### Keep It Current
- The dashboard is only useful if it's updated
- Even quick notes are better than none
- Focus on accuracy over detail

### Be Specific
- Instead of "Worked on Chapter 3"
- Write "Chapter 3: Added protagonist's confession scene, 1,200 words"

### Track Decisions
- Document choices that affect the whole book
- This prevents contradictions later
- Helps AI maintain consistency

### Use the AI Quick Start
- Explicitly tell AI which 2-3 documents matter most right now
- This saves time and improves AI responses
- Update it as project focus shifts

## Common Patterns

### Planning Phase
- AI Quick Start: 00_overview.md, 01_outline.md, 02_characters.md

## Remember

The 00_overview.md is a living document. It should evolve with your project and reflect your current reality, not an idealized plan. Keep it honest, current, and useful.
