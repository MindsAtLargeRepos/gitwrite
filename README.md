# Writing Project Template

A comprehensive template for organizing and writing any form of content - from novels to cookbooks, technical manuals to blog series, using a structured Markdown-based approach optimized for AI-human collaboration.

## Overview

This template provides a complete framework for any writing project, from initial concept to final publication. Whether you're writing a novel, creating a cookbook, developing technical documentation, crafting a blog series, or any other form of written content, this flexible system adapts to your needs. **Special AI-focused documents help maintain consistency and natural writing style when collaborating with AI writing assistants.**

The **AI_README.md** file serves as a comprehensive briefing document for any AI assistant. Simply share this file at the start of a new conversation to give the AI complete context about the project without needing to explain the entire system.
