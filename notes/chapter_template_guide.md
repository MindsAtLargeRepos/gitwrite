# Chapter Template Philosophy

## Why We Simplified

The chapter template has been intentionally simplified to encourage creativity rather than constrain it. 

### What Changed

**Old Approach:**
- Prescriptive structure with sections to fill out
- Detailed writing instructions in each chapter
- Paint-by-numbers approach

**New Approach:**
- Minimal metadata for tracking
- Open space for creative writing
- Flexible notes sections
- Writing guidance moved to style guide

### Benefits

1. **Creative Freedom** - Write naturally without structural constraints
2. **Less Redundancy** - Universal principles aren't repeated in every chapter
3. **Better Organization** - Writing guidance centralized in style guide
4. **Practical Tracking** - Focus on what actually helps maintain continuity

### How to Use

1. **Start Writing** - Don't overthink the structure, just begin
2. **Track Metadata** - Update status, word count, and dates
3. **Add Notes** - Capture insights and connections as they emerge
4. **Stay Flexible** - Use only the sections that help you

### Where to Find Guidance

- **Chapter Structure:** See "Chapter Structure Principles" in `06_style_guide_ai.md`
- **Scene Structure:** See `10_scene_beat_tracker.md`
- **Voice Consistency:** See `09_character_voice_guide.md`
- **General Style:** See relevant sections in `06_style_guide_ai.md`

### Remember

The best chapter is one that tells your story effectively. The template is there to help you track your work, not dictate how you write it.
