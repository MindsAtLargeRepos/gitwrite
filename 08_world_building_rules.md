# Rules and Constraints: [Project Title]

*This document establishes the immutable rules, constraints, and boundaries for your project. These are the "laws" that must never be broken to maintain internal consistency and credibility.*

## Core Rules

### Fundamental Constraints
These are the absolute rules that define the boundaries of your project:

1. **[Rule Name]**
   - Definition: [Clear explanation of the rule]
   - Implications: [What this means in practice]
   - Examples: [Specific applications]
   - NEVER: [What must never happen]

2. **[Rule Name]**
   - Definition: [Explanation]
   - Implications: [Practical effects]
   - Examples: [Applications]
   - NEVER: [Forbidden elements]

3. **[Rule Name]**
   - Definition: [Explanation]
   - Implications: [Effects]
   - Examples: [Uses]
   - NEVER: [What breaks this rule]

[Continue for all fundamental rules]

## Domain-Specific Rules

### [Domain/Category 1: e.g., Technical Specifications]

**Operating Principles:**
- [How things work in this domain]
- [Limitations and capabilities]
- [Cause and effect relationships]

**Constraints:**
- Cannot: [List what's impossible]
- Must: [List what's required]
- Always: [List constants]

**Edge Cases:**
- [Scenario]: [How the rules apply]
- [Exception]: [If any, with strict conditions]

### [Domain/Category 2: e.g., Character/Behavioral Rules]

**Established Patterns:**
- [Behavioral constraints based on established traits]
- [Relationship dynamics that cannot change]
- [Skill/knowledge limitations]

**Growth Boundaries:**
- Can learn: [What's possible to develop]
- Cannot suddenly: [Unrealistic changes]
- Must maintain: [Core characteristics]

### [Domain/Category 3: e.g., Environmental/Setting Rules]

**Physical Laws:**
- [How the environment operates]
- [What's possible vs impossible]
- [Consistent environmental factors]

**Access/Availability:**
- Available: [Resources, tools, options]
- Unavailable: [What doesn't exist]
- Restricted: [Limited access items/areas]

## Logical Consistency Rules

### Cause and Effect
- If [A] then must [B]
- When [X] happens, [Y] always follows
- Cannot have [C] without first establishing [D]

### Information Flow
- Who can know what and when
- How information spreads
- What remains secret and why

### Power Dynamics
- Who has authority over what
- What challenges authority
- How power is gained/lost

## Creative Boundaries

### Style Constraints
- Tone must remain: [Consistent tone elements]
- Never include: [Inappropriate elements for your project]
- Always maintain: [Essential style features]

### Content Boundaries
- Appropriate for: [Target audience]
- Avoid: [Content to exclude]
- Handle carefully: [Sensitive topics]

### Structural Rules
- Format must: [Structural requirements]
- Each section needs: [Required elements]
- Never exceed: [Length/complexity limits]

## Established Facts That Create Rules

Sometimes rules emerge from facts you've already established:

### From Established Facts
- Because [established fact], must [resulting rule]
- Since [character trait/event], cannot [impossibility]
- Given [situation], always [consequence]

### Precedent-Based Rules
- In Section X, established that: [Precedent]
- Therefore must maintain: [Resulting rule]
- Cannot contradict by: [What would break it]

## Flexibility Within Rules

### Where Creative Freedom Exists
- Within [rule], can still: [Creative options]
- As long as [constraint met], free to: [Possibilities]
- [Rule] allows for: [Variations]

### Gray Areas
- [Situation]: [How to handle ambiguity]
- [Edge case]: [Guidelines for decision]
- When unclear: [Default approach]

## Common Pitfalls

### Rules Often Broken by Accident
1. **[Common mistake]**
   - Why it happens: [Reason]
   - How to avoid: [Prevention method]
   - Check by: [Verification method]

2. **[Common mistake]**
   - Why it happens: [Reason]  
   - How to avoid: [Prevention]
   - Check by: [Verification]

### Warning Signs
- If writing [X], check rule about [Y]
- When tempted to [action], remember [constraint]
- Before adding [element], verify [rule compliance]

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before writing any new section, verify:

- [ ] No fundamental rules broken
- [ ] Domain-specific constraints honored
- [ ] Logical consistency maintained
- [ ] Creative boundaries respected
- [ ] Established facts not contradicted

## Rule Evolution Notes
